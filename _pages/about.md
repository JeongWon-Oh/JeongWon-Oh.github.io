Hello, I'm Jeong Won Oh. You may also call me David Kim Oh. 
I'm planned to enter Tokyo Institute of Technology in Apr. 2022.
I'll study for master's degree in Information and Communications Engineering as a member of Computer ARchitecture And Security Lab (CARAS), under the supervision of Prof. Sasaki.
