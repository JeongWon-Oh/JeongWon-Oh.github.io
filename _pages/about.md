Hello, I'm Jeong Won Oh. You may also call me David Kim Oh.

>
I'm planned to enter <a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english">Tokyo Institute of Technology</a> in April 2022.
I'll study for a master's degree in Information and Communications Engineering as a member of <a href="https://titech-caras.github.io/index-en.html">CARAS</a>, under the supervision of Prof. Sasaki.

>
I'll receive a B.S. degree from Yonsei University in February 2022. I majored in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the College of Engineering.
